# BitcoinSranan Website

Welcome to **BitcoinSranan**, a community initiative building a circular Bitcoin economy in Suriname.  
This repository contains the content and structure for our public website.

## 🌍 Mission
BitcoinSranan is creating a local and global bridge:
- **For locals:** Practical information, onboarding guides, and a community hub to learn and use Bitcoin in daily life.
- **For internationals:** Transparent updates, donation opportunities, and insights into how Bitcoin can empower small economies like Suriname.

## 📌 What’s happening now
- Building the **Community Hub** at the old Surinamese House – a physical space for workshops, meetups, and merchant onboarding.
- Onboarding local shops with **Lightning payments** and **BoltCards**.
- Preparing for international visitors and Bitcoin migrants.
- Developing educational resources in English and Dutch.
